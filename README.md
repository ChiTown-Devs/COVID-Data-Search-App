## USAGE

Our main concern in creating the application was make it simple and accesible, thinking primarily in our users. To properly use the app you can follow these simple steps:  

1. Use the button "Current Location" to get real-time updates on Covid-19 in your area.
2. Use the button "Search City" to view the cases at your destination when planning travel.  
3. You also can use the tweet section to get the latest Covid-19 news for any location.
